# X Marks Your Start

[X Marks Your Start](https://www.xmarksyourstart.com) is a website that provides information about the events, music, and films that may have led to your conception.

This project was created for my Ada Developers Academy final capstone project. The project is built in Ruby on Rails and leverages a DynamoDB database. The app also depends on Travis for deployment, Skeleton for the CSS framework, and Mailgun for sending emails.  The app is hosted on Elastic Beanstalk.

This application was developed alongside the DayPI API which provides events (historical, weather, sports), top songs, and top movies for a given date or day range.  This ReadMe will be updated to include API documentation as soon as the API is publicly available.
